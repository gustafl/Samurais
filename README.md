This repo contains a solution with three C# projects, each illustrating a different way of doing dependency injection.

* Constructor Injection
* Setter Injection
* Interface Injection

The first is based on [a Ninject example](https://github.com/ninject/Ninject/wiki/Dependency-Injection-By-Hand
"Dependency Injection By Hand") . The other two are the same example adapted to the other two patterns for easy
comparison.

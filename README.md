# Samurais
This repo contains a solution with three C# projects, each illustrating a different way of doing **dependency injection** by hand.

* Constructor Injection
* Setter Injection
* Interface Injection

The first is based on an example from the [Ninject wiki](https://github.com/ninject/Ninject/wiki/Dependency-Injection-By-Hand
"Dependency Injection By Hand"). The other two are the same example adapted to the other two patterns for easy comparison.
